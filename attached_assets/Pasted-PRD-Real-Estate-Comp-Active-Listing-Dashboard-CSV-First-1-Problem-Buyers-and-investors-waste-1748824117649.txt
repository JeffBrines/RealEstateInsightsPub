PRD ­– Real-Estate Comp & Active-Listing Dashboard (CSV-First)
1. Problem
Buyers and investors waste hours scraping MLS exports into spreadsheets, then manually slicing the data to spot value or market trends. They need an instant, visual, drill-down view of comps and active listings without writing formulas.

2. Goal
Ship a web app that turns any standard CSV export (sold comps or active listings) into an interactive, filter-rich dashboard plus an AI layer that answers natural-language questions about the data.

3. Users
Investor / Flipper – cares about spread, days on market, flip ROI

Buy-and-hold Landlord – focused on rent, cap rate, long-term trend

Primary-home Buyer – wants like-for-like comps, school scores, price trajectory

Agent / Broker – needs quick, shareable market snapshots for clients

4. Core KPIs to Display (MVP)
Median and average sale price

Median and average list price

Sale-to-list ratio

Price per square foot (list and sold)

Days on market (median, average, distribution)

Closed sales count, new listings count

Months of inventory, absorption rate

Price change frequency and median reduction

Bed/bath distribution, living sqft, lot size

Cash vs financed share

Rental metrics: estimated rent, GRM, cap rate (use external rent API)

5. Functional Requirements
#	Must Have	Acceptance Test
F-1	CSV Upload – drag-and-drop or file selector. Support at least 2 MB, 10k rows.	File parses without error and shows row count.
F-2	Schema Detection – auto-map common headers (Price, Beds, Sold Date, etc.). Provide manual override UI.	At least 90 % of sample file columns correctly mapped on first pass.
F-3	Data Clean & Normalize – strip currency symbols, handle missing sqft, coerce dates to ISO.	Data types shown correctly in preview grid.
F-4	KPI Engine – compute KPIs listed in section 4 in < 2 s for 10k rows.	KPI widgets render values matching hand-checked spreadsheet.
F-5	Interactive Filters – time range, geography (zip, city), price band, beds, baths, property type. Cascading and multi-select.	Changing a filter updates all charts in < 250 ms.
F-6	Visuals – price trend line, price-per-sqft heatmap, DOM histogram, inventory gauge. Use Plotly or ECharts.	Charts render responsively on desktop and mobile.
F-7	Property Drill-Down – click any datapoint to open a table of matching listings with photos and key fields.	User can export the filtered table to CSV.
F-8	AI Q&A (v1) – chat box where user asks, e.g., “What’s the median price for 3-bed homes in 83455 last quarter?” and gets an answer plus chart snapshot.	95 % of test queries return correct numeric answer.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance – dashboard initial render < 3 s on 10k-row file.

Security – files processed in browser (no upload) for MVP.

Scalability – design service layer to swap in database when we accept > 50 k rows.

Browser Support – last 2 versions of Chrome, Edge, Safari.

No external data stored – comply with user privacy until accounts feature added.

7. Data Pipeline (CSV-only MVP)
Client-side Papaparse → JSON

Column-mapping heuristic + manual override

Compute KPIs in Web Worker (avoid UI jank)

Render React + Plotly dashboard

Embed DuckDB-wasm later for larger files

8. AI Layer
Query parser: OpenAI function-calling model with JSON schema for filter parameters

Execution: Feed parsed filters to same KPI engine, return JSON → natural-language summary

Guardrails: Reject requests not supported by data schema

9. Stretch Goals (post-MVP)
Merge multiple CSVs (sold + active)

Cloud upload with S3 presigned URLs

User accounts and saved dashboards

Forecast widget (LightGBM on price trend)

Map view with Leaflet heat layers

Zapier webhook to auto-pull new MLS exports

10. Tech Stack
React + Vite

Plotly.js for charts

TanStack Table for grids

Papaparse for CSV

OpenAI GPT-4o via serverless edge function

Optional: DuckDB-wasm for big files

11. Milestones & Timing
Week	Deliverable
1	File upload, schema detection UI
2	KPI engine + preview grid
3	Core charts and filter panel
4	Property drill-down and export
5	AI Q&A prototype
6	Polish, responsiveness, test suite

12. Success Metrics
< 5 min from file upload to insight for first-time user

95 % KPI accuracy vs spreadsheet benchmark

AI answers NPS ≥ 8 from pilot users

Time on dashboard per session ≥ 4 minutes

13. Open Questions
Which rent API do we license for cap-rate calc?

Do we standardize on Zillow or FIPS geo codes for location filter?

How do we handle photo URLs that require MLS auth?

Deliver this spec to engineering and design. First demo expected end of week 3.
